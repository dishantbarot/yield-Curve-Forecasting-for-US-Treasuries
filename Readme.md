# 📈 Yield Curve Forecasting for US Treasuries  
### Machine Learning–Based Forecasting of U.S. Treasury Yield Curve Dynamics

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Yield Curve Predictor** is a machine learning–driven financial analytics project designed to model, predict, and interpret movements in the U.S. Treasury yield curve.

The yield curve encapsulates market expectations about **economic growth, inflation, and monetary policy**, making it a critical tool for fixed-income investors, policymakers, and macroeconomic analysts.

This project integrates **real-time financial data**, **finance-driven feature engineering**, **supervised machine learning**, and **interactive visualization** to deliver both **quantitative predictions** and **economic insights**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Fetch real-time U.S. Treasury yield data (1-month to 30-year maturities)
- Engineer economically meaningful yield-curve features
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for interest-rate forecasting
- Predict the next-period **10-Year Treasury yield**
- Visualize yield curve dynamics and inversions
- Explain the economic significance of yield movements
- Deploy the solution as an interactive **Streamlit application**

---

## 🧠 Why the Yield Curve Matters

The yield curve represents the relationship between **interest rates and time to maturity**.

It provides insights into:
- Economic expansion or slowdown
- Inflation expectations
- Central bank policy stance
- Recession risk

### Yield Curve Inversion
When short-term rates (e.g., 2Y) exceed long-term rates (e.g., 10Y), the curve becomes **inverted**.  
Historically, yield curve inversions have preceded most U.S. recessions, making them one of the most reliable macroeconomic indicators.

## 📊 Data Acquisition

**Source:** Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)  
**Library Used:** `fredapi`

### Treasury Maturities Used
- 1 Month (1M)
- 3 Month (3M)
- 1 Year (1Y)
- 2 Year (2Y)
- 5 Year (5Y)
- 10 Year (10Y)
- 30 Year (30Y)

The data is:
- Time-indexed
- Aligned across maturities
- Cleaned for missing values
- Cached to minimize API calls

## 🧮 Feature Engineering (Core Intelligence Layer)

Feature engineering is driven by fixed-income theory and macroeconomic intuition.

### 1️⃣ Yield Spreads
Capture yield curve shape and recession signals:
- 10Y − 2Y
- 5Y − 3M
- 30Y − 10Y

### 2️⃣ Rolling Statistics
Capture market regimes:
- 30-day and 90-day volatility
- 30-day and 90-day moving averages

### 3️⃣ Lag Features
Capture market memory and autocorrelation:
- 1-day, 5-day, and 10-day lag of the 10Y yield

All features are created **before a final NaN cleanup** to preserve time-series integrity.

## 🎯 Target Variable

**Prediction Task:**  
Forecast the **next-period 10-Year Treasury yield** using only information available at the current time.

This ensures:
- No data leakage
- Causal and realistic forecasting
- Production-ready modeling

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

### Baseline Model
- **Linear Regression**
- Used for interpretability and benchmarking

### Final Model (Deployed)
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- Captures non-linear relationships and regime shifts
- Robust to noise and macroeconomic transitions

The deployed model is stored as a **package** containing:
- Trained model object
- Feature column schema (for deployment safety)

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Evaluation metrics:
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
- **R² Score**

Models are evaluated using **time-aware train/test splits** to simulate real-world forecasting conditions.
